.Net command-line program to decode Motorola trunking signal.

The program decodes a 3600 baud Motorola trunking signal piped into the machine via a soundcard.
The source of the signal has to come from a scanner before the discriminator (which destroys the
signal). See my repository TrunkingDataCollect for a tool to log the trunking channel activity
to a database as so from the command line:
